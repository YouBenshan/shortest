# shortest

Java base implement of short-path
algorithms: [Contraction hierarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies), [Transit node routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_node_routing), [Hierarchical Hub Labeling](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=168725).

some code is inspired by [jGrapht](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/) and improved for better performance using [fastutil](https://github.com/vigna/fastutil) and multi-thread.

Data used in Test class (offline/src/test/java/you/bs/shortest/offline/GrTest.java) is from [Dimacs 9 Challenge](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml).
